## Notetastic 
Introducing Notetastic, the ultimate notes sharing platform designed to revolutionize the way students collaborate and learn. With Notetastic, students can seamlessly share and compare class notes, fostering a collaborative learning environment. Professors can create dedicated class pages, endorse answers, and ensure academic integrity. Teaching Assistants can provide support and flag inappropriate content. Department administrators gain insights into department-wide activity. Notetastic empowers students to ask questions, and build a comprehensive understanding of course material. It's the go-to solution for efficient, organized, and note-taking.

The UI has screens for 3 major personas: Professors, Teaching Assistants, and Students, including a variety of GET, PUT, POST, and DELETE endpoints. Professors can create classes, create folders within those classes for notes, and add and remove TAs and students to classes. They also have the power to edit or remove notes as needed. TAs can upload their office hours availiability for students to view, view all notes posted in their classes and leave comments on notes, as well as report any notes they deem to be inappropriate or a violation of class policies. Students can view the notes posted by other students in the classes they are in and post comments on those notes, as well as post their own notes.

Please note that due to some git merge conflicts and general issues, our main branch is called main-branch, NOT main.
